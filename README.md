## Introduction

This repository contains a deliberately vulnerable REST API that is designed to showcase common security vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, authentication bypass, and other attacks. This project is intended for educational purposes only.

## Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT:** This project intentionally exposes security vulnerabilities and should NOT be used in a production environment.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to work as a learning experience.

## Vulnerabilities

The vulnerable REST API includes examples of the following security vulnerabilities:

- SQL Injection: Demonstrates how improper handling of user input can lead to unauthorized access to the database.
- Authentication Bypass: Illustrates how inadequate authentication mechanisms can allow unauthorized access to protected resources.
- Cryptographic Vulnerabilities: Highlights the risks associated with storing plain text passwords in the database.
